# What is this trash

This ugly little repo is just a response to someone online who asked about immutable data structures in response to an old comment of mine.

It demonstrates readers and writers operating unblocked on each other against a simple immutable tree structure that shares branches between versions.

There's various opinionated prattle in the source.

Consider the source BSD, but only use it for play, and not really anything serious.

It's just a poorly hacked together demonstration.

# How do I compile this garbage?

`go build example.go` should create an `example` binary you can run.

I only ran it under linux, but see no reason it wouldn't work under anything else.
